        lyrics: `
Oh, damn, oh, damn, oh, damn
I'm so perplexed with just one breath, I'm locked in
Oh, damn, oh, damn, oh, damn
I'm so perplexed, oh that, it's almost shocking
I know, I know you know you're scared
Your heart, your mind, your soul, your body, yeah
They won't, they won't, they won't be careful
But I guess that you don't know me

'Cause if I want you, then I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
'Cause space was just a word
Made up by someone who's afraid to get too

Close, ooh
Oh, so close, ooh
I want you close, ooh
'Cause space was just a word
Made up by someone who's afraid to get
Close, ooh
Oh, so close, ooh
I want you close, ooh
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no

Oh, man, oh, man, I am not really known
For ever being speechless (yeah, yeah)
But now, but now somehow
My words roll off my tongue right onto your lips, ah (oh yeah)
I'm keeping cool while you keep smiling
Saying all the things I'm thinking (oh, baby)
Oh, man, oh, man, I am like you
So I want proof I'm what you're feeling (whoa ooh)

'Cause if I want you, then I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards (going backwards), won't ask for space
'Cause space was just a word
Made up by someone who's afraid to get too

Close, ooh (ooh)
Oh, so close, ooh
I want you close, ooh (yeah, baby)
'Cause space was just a word
Made up by someone who's afraid to get
Close, ooh (ooh)
Oh, so close, ooh
I want you close, ooh (I want you)
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no

'Cause if I want you, then I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
'Cause space was just a word
Made up by someone who's afraid to get too
Close!

Close, ooh (close, baby)
Oh, so close, ooh
I want you close (yeah), ooh (baby)
'Cause space was just a word
Made up by someone who's afraid to get
Close, ooh (so get close, baby)
Oh, so close, ooh (now baby, oh)
I want you close, ooh (now tell me)
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no

Yeah, baby (close)
Now tell me, baby, what you want (close, ooh)
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no`
